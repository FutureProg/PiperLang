# Piper Programming Language
**Piper** is a programming language inspired by reactive frameworks such as [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) and its associated libraries. Piper is similar to other existing languages, but its functions are instead subscribers to other functions, referred to as pipes. 

***More information on the language will be provided at a later date.***
